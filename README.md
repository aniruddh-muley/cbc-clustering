Presentation: [Unsupervised ML and CBC](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jO5xu81CVqZeU4P8wew1k9lqHy093Cxw/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=115563981610636075357&rtpof=true&sd=true)

These are the notebooks that I have been working on, locally and on Kaggle. The list is incomplete, and I cannot share the dataset for privacy reasons. </br>

The code in these notebooks is unorganized (due to a lot of experimentation), and will be cleaned/fixed once the project ends.
